# wTFI-plus
Improved weakly-supervised total field inversion for QSM

I made several modification to improve the previously proposed wTFI.
(1) convolution with boundary padding to address the inaccuate susceptibility estimation at brain boundaries
(2) background field perturbation ...
(3) fake bleeding perturbation ...
(4)

I will upload the code soon! Any question please contact Juan Liu, juan.liu313@gmail.com.
